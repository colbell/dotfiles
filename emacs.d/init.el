;;; package --- My Emacs configuration

;;; Commentary:

;; My Emacs configuaration is stored in colbell.org and is
;; compiled into colbell.el via org-babel-load-file.

;;; Code:

;; Use org-babel-load-file to compile colbell.org into colbell.el and
;; then load colbell.el. Only do this if colbell.el doesn't exist or
;; if colbell.org is newer than colbell.el.

;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; You may delete these explanatory comments.

;; Remove Unnecessary Clutter early to avoid momentary display. I also turn off
;; the menu-bar in .Xresources in order to stop the momentary flicker.
